# Master Thesis Project 2020
This repository contains all python code from my master thesis: The Effects of Methylphenidate on Brain Structures of ADHD Diagnosed Children-Explorative Analyses using Radiomic Features.
(https://nmbu.brage.unit.no/nmbu-xmlui/handle/11250/2724853).

Most files are written specifically for the analysed dataset. "Main_autoscaling.py", which is used to produce normalized segments of the images for later analyses, is relatively generalized and partially documented. 
The dataset is not provided due to privacy reasons. 

Folder "Visualization" contains various scripts for visualizing image and analysis statistics.
Folder "Data handeling" contains scripts need to create my dataset, like extracting images from their original format and renaming files.
